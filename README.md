# Photo Generative AI Application

This is a photo generative AI application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application generates unique photos based on random prompts.

## Features

- **Generative AI**: The application utilizes advanced generative AI algorithms to create unique and realistic photos based on random prompts.
- **Random Prompts**: Users can input random prompts or keywords to generate photos that match their desired criteria.
- **MERN Stack**: The application is built using the MERN stack, which provides a robust and scalable foundation for the backend and frontend development.
- **MongoDB**: The application uses MongoDB as the database to store and manage user data and generated photos.
- **Express.js**: The backend is built using Express.js, a fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- **React.js**: The frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: The backend runs on Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment that allows for server-side execution of JavaScript code.
